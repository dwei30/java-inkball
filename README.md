# Inkball Game in Java

This project is a replica of the Inkball game found in older versions of Windows, developed in Java using the Processing library for graphics. The game involves directing colored balls into holes of matching color using player-drawn lines. If a ball enters a wrong hole, the score is penalized, and the ball respawns. The objective is to capture all the balls by guiding them to the correct holes.

## Features:
- Ball spawning with random velocities
- Player-drawn lines that reflect balls
- Collision detection with walls and player lines
- Score adjustments based on ball and hole color matching
- Timer for each level and multiple level support
- Win and loss conditions based on ball capture and time expiration
- Pause and restart functionality
- Yellow tiles moving along the game board after completing a level

## Software Requirements:
- Java 8
- Gradle
- Processing 4.0b1 (core and data libraries)
- JSON library for configuration handling
